# Challenge

### Overview
An extra analysis is been asked to complete the previous results to confirm voter turnout for each county. The new information should be added to the output results file *election_analysis.txt*.

### Summary
The new analysis shows that three counties have participated in the elections:
- **Jefferson**
- **Denver**
- **Arapahoe**

The votes casted by each county and its percentage of the total, were as follows:
- Jefferson's turnout was **10.5%** with 38,855 number of voters.
- Denver's turnout was **82.8%** with 306,055 number of voters. 
- Arapahoe's turnout was **6.7%** with 24,801 number of voters.

The above figures confirm that the county with the largest turnout was **Denver**.
